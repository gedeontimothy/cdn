# Local CDN

This project is an application built with the Laravel framework, dedicated to setting up a local CDN (Content Delivery Network) system. The goal is to provide an efficient solution for distributing static files (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) across a local network, thereby improving loading times and the performance of applications.

## Installation and Setup

Installs all the project dependencies defined in the `composer.json` file.

```bash
composer install
```

Copies the example file `.env.example` to `.env` for application configurations.

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # for Linux and MacOS
copy .env.example .env  # for Windows
```

Generates an application key and adds it to the `.env` file.

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Executes the database migrations, creating the necessary tables.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Starts a local development server at the address `http://127.0.1.1`.

> *Note:*
>> You can configure the host in the `server-*-server.(bat|sh)` files located in the [app/bin/](app/bin/) directory.<br/>
>> You can also start the server by running these server startup files without the console command.<br/>
>> If you are on MacOS, your server startup file is [`server-linux-server.sh`](app/bin/start-linux-server.sh).

```bash
composer serve
```
##### Local Domain
You can generate the local domain name by running (as administrator mode) the following command:

```shell
php artisan app:local-domain
```

This command will configure the local domain names `cdn.net` and `www.cdn.net` for the IP address `127.0.1.1`.

However, you can still modify the domain names to be generated for your chosen IP address. Just display the help for the command by running:

```bash
php artisan app:local-domain -h
```

> The domain name is stored in the file :
> - _Sur Windows_ : `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
> - _Sur Linux et MacOS_ : `/etc/hosts`

## Initialize data in the CDN database

Start by configuring the folders where your files are located.
In the `app` configuration file, add the `file_init` key:

> Or you can also configure your folders directly in the method [`App\Console\Commands\InitLocalFile::getFolders`](app/Console/Commands/InitLocalFile.php)

```php
    // ...
    'file_init' => [
        [
            // folder is required: string|array
            'folder' => '/absolute_folder_path', // Or ['/absolute_folder_path_1', '/absolute_folder_path_2']

            // categories are optional: array - default: []
            'categories' => ['category1', 'categoryX'],

            // only-extension is optional: array - default: []
            'only-extension' => ['jpeg' /*, 'mp4', 'c', */],

            // recursive-folder is optional: bool - default: false
            'recursive-folder' => true,

            // type is optional: string|callable - default: function autoTypeDetect(): string|null
                // The autoTypeDetect function returns 'document', 'font', 'audio', 'image', 'video', 'text' or NULL as file types
            'type' => 'file-type',
        ],
        // ...
    ]
```

Then run the following command to create the database data linked to the files in your folders

```bash
php artisan app:init-local-file
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
